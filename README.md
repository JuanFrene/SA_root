This codes belong to the project: A non-canonical salicylic acid signalling network modulates root development and its microbiota composition in plants.

Abstract: Besides playing a crucial role in plant immunity, increasing evidence shows that salicylic acid (SA) is also involved in regulating plant root architecture. However, 
the transcriptional regulatory network and core regulators controlling SA-mediated plant root development, and whether these regulators are functionally conserved in angiosperms,
are still unclear. Here, we found that, like that in Arabidopsis, exogenous SA attenuates root growth in rice via a parallel pathway of immune response. We further reconstructed
the regulatory network of SA regulating rice root development and identified new regulators by blocking the immune signaling using relevant mutants. Loss-of-function of these 
regulators altered the response of rice roots to SA treatment and reshaped the root-associated microbiome colonization, which is basically conserved in the eudicot Arabidopsis. 
Our results provide new insights and novel breeding targets for mitigating plant defense-growth tradeoffs to enhance crop performance.
